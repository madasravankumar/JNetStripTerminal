 Implement this protocol to handle updates when checking for and installing

 Terminal, you are obligated to include this functionality.

/**
 A software update is available to be installed on the connected reader
 hardware. You should notify your app's user that an update is available, and
 ask if they want to proceed with the update.

 If an update is initiated, the reader will become unresponsive until the
 update is complete. In some cases, you will need to restart the reader at the
 end of the update.

 You should use the `didReportReaderSoftwareUpdateProgress` delegate
 method to signal the progress of the update to your user. After the update
 completes, the `didCompleteReaderSoftwareUpdate` delegate method will be called
 to indicate whether the update was successfully completed.

 @param terminal        The originating terminal.

 @param update          An object containing information about the available
 software update.

 @param installUpdate   Call this block with a boolean value indicating whether
 you want to proceed with the update. Calling `installUpdate(true)` begins
 installing the udpate.
