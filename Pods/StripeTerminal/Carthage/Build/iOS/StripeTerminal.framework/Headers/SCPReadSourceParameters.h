/**
 Parameters for reading a source.

 **NOTE: Most integrations should **not** use `readSource`.**

 You should create a `PaymentIntent` and use the associated `collectPaymentMethod`
 and `confirmPaymentIntent` methods if you are simply collecting a payment from
 a customer.

 You can use `readSource` to read payment details and defer payment for later.
 To do this, you will need to turn the "card present" source into a
 "card not present" source, which you can use to charge the customer online.

 Note that if you use this method to defer a payment, the transaction will
 *not* receive the beneficial rates and liability shift associated with card
 present transactions.
