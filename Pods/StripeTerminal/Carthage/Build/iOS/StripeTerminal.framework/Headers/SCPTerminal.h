 Clears the current connection token, saved reader sessions, and any other

 In order to switch accounts in your app:
 - if a reader is connected, call `disconnect`
 - configure the `tokenProvider` to return connection tokens for the new account
 - call `clearCachedCredentials`
 - call `discover` and `connect` to connect to a reader. The `connect` call will
 request a new connection token from your backend server via the token provider.
 
 An overview of the lifecycle of a connection token under the hood:
 - When a Terminal is initialized, the SDK attempts to proactively request
 a connection token from your backend server.
 - When `connect` is called, the SDK uses the connection token and reader
 information to create a reader session.
 - Subsequent calls to `connect` will re-use the reader session if this `SCPTerminal`
 has successfully connected to the reader already. Otherwise, it will require a
 new connection token when you call `connect` again.

 Confirms a PaymentIntent. Call this immediately after receiving a
 PaymentIntent from collectPaymentMethod.
 
 When confirming a PaymentIntent fails, the SDK returns an error that includes
 the updated PaymentIntent. Your app should inspect the updated PaymentIntent
 to decide how to retry the payment.

 If the updated PaymentIntent is `nil`, the request to Stripe's servers timed
 out and the PaymentIntent's status is unknown. We recommend that you retry
 confirming the original PaymentIntent. If you instead choose to abandon the
 original PaymentIntent and create a new one, do not to capture the original
 PaymentIntent. If you do, you might charge your customer twice.

 If the updated PaymentIntent's status is still `requires_confirmation` (e.g.,
 the request failed because your app is not connected to the internet), you
 can call `confirmPaymentIntent` again with the updated PaymentIntent to retry
 the request.

 If the updated PaymentIntent's status changes to `requires_source` (e.g., the
 request failed because the card was declined), call `collectPaymentMethod` with the
 updated PaymentIntent to try charging another card.

 If confirming the PaymentIntent succeeds, the completion block will be called
 with a PaymentIntent object with status RequiresCapture,

 Stripe Terminal uses two-step card payments to prevent unintended and duplicate
 payments. When the SDK returns a confirmed PaymentIntent to your app, a charge
 has been authorized but not yet settled, or captured. On your backend, capture
 the confirmed PaymentIntent.

 Reads a payment method with the given parameters and returns a source.

 **NOTE: Most integrations should **not** use `readSource`.**

 You should create a `PaymentIntent` and use the associated `collectPaymentMethod`
 and `confirmPaymentIntent` methods if you are simply collecting a payment from
 a customer.

 You can use `readSource` to read payment details and defer payment for later.
 To do this, you will need to turn the "card present" source into a
 "card not present" source, which you can use to charge the customer online.

 Note that if you use this method to defer a payment, the transaction will
 *not* receive the beneficial rates and liability shift associated with card
 present transactions.

 If reading a source fails, the completion block will be called with an error
 containing details about the failure. If reading a source succeeds, the
 completion block will be called with a `CardPresentSource`. You should send
 the ID of the source to your backend for further processing. For example,
 you can use source's fingerprint to look up a charge created using the same
 card.
