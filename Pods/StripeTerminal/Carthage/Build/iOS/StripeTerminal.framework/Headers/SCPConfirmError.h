/**
 The updated PaymentIntent after a confirm request errors.

 If the status of the updated PaymentIntent is still `RequiresConfirmation`
 (e.g the request failed because your app is not connected to the internet),
 you may call `confirmPaymentIntent` again with the updated PaymentIntent to
 retry the request.

 If the status of the updated PaymentIntent is `RequiresSource` (e.g. the
 request failed because the card was declined), you should call `collectPaymentMethod`
 with the updated PaymentIntent to try charging another card.

 If this value is nil, the request timed out, and the status of the
 PaymentIntent is unknown. We recommend that you retry confirming the original
 PaymentIntent. If you instead choose to abandon the original PaymentIntent
 and create a new one, you should be sure not to capture the original
 PaymentIntent. On your backend, consider reconciling PaymentIntents with your
 internal orders system to clean up any dangling authorizations.
